This is a NVM logging implementation on postgresql-9.6.0.
The idea and mechanism was presented at PGCon 2016 
can be found at https://www.pgcon.org/2016/schedule/events/945.en.html.

To activate the NVM Logging you describe one GUC parameter 
in postgresql.conf as the following.
PRAM_FILE_NAME="NVM File name"

If you have no NVM (or persistent memory) on your DB server that uses Linux,
you can examine the NVM logging by using pseudo pram driver that can be
obtained from https://github.com/meistervonperf/pseudo-pram.

cf. Original README file in the postgresql-9.6.0 directory is renamed 
   to README-original.
